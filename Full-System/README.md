# Dual Biometric Authentication System

This project includes several Python scripts that contribute to a system designed for gait and fingerprint analysis. Below is a brief description of each script:

## Gait_match.py

This script likely contains the logic for matching gait patterns. It may compare gait data from different sessions or against a database for identification or authentication purposes.

## gait_model.py

Focused on the modeling aspect of gait analysis, this script might include definitions for gait models, possibly incorporating machine learning algorithms to recognize or classify gait patterns.

## main.py

Typically, `main.py` serves as the entry point to a Python project. It likely orchestrates the flow of the program, calling functions from other scripts and ensuring the overall process runs smoothly.

## Silh.py

This script's name suggests it might be related to silhouette processing, possibly involving the extraction or manipulation of silhouettes from video frames for gait analysis.

## userClass.py

A script named `userClass.py` would logically define a user class, encapsulating properties and methods related to users in the context of the system, such as storing user details or managing user sessions.

## video_capture.py

As the name implies, this script is responsible for video capture functionality, possibly interfacing with hardware to record video or capture frames for further analysis.

## debug.py

This utility script might be used for debugging purposes, providing tools or functions to log messages, monitor variables, or test specific sections of the code.

## Enrollment.py

The `Enrollment.py` script likely handles the enrollment process for users, which could involve capturing and storing biometric data (like fingerprints or gait patterns) in a database.

## Fingerprint_Matching.py

Focused on fingerprint analysis, this script probably contains algorithms or methods for matching fingerprints, either for identification or verification purposes.
